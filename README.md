Text/book slicer for producing random phrase Oracles for solo RPG play.

The input text is sliced into fragments which are loaded into a spreadsheet for random selection. You can upload any text file. [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) is a great place to find public domain genre fiction already in text format for use with this tool. You may want to remove any unwanted text first. You can upload multiple files in one go and they will all be placed into a single spreadsheet.
